Spatia (Spa-tia, Latin for Spaces)
Ordiri (Latin for I begin to weave)


The Ground of Creation
contains
The Loom of Knowledge (called.. the artifice or something)


Fabrics = Palaces = Myst Ages
(Fabric = a building, workshop)

The first thread connects The Ground to The Loom of Knowledge


##### Ordiri

Ordiri-Type property indicates view of this file should be taken over by the Ordiri renderer..

(Knowledge vs Type?)
Knowledge = a Type System
Knowledge of Knowledge = the Type Concept


(EOC)
Knowledge: Process-Objects-Concepts 

Knowledge is the base type, with name, definition.

All store YAML Properties according to their Type.
hierarchical ontology according to "tags" property.
Relations according to unreserved properties.

Body of document is "details"

Tag hierarchies -> Property inheritance
Tag/Type Directory that specifies property templates


All Entries:
- entry location?
- tags
- links (out)

**Events :**
involve Objects, exemplify concepts. lifecycle: (Initiation, Transformation, Destruction)
state changes, interactions, creation / destruction events
Parallel vs Serial events, nested structure?
- Objects
- Concepts

**Objects :**
extensional being, properties respond to process conditions

**Concepts :**
generalizations of processes / objects (object hierarchy)
intensional being, (prerequisites, uses, dependencies)


What does this all even add beyond obsidian?
object inheritance = templates
namespaced relations
Custom UI


processes provide conditions which may instantiate, transform, or destroy objects (which are themselves processes)
The baseline process is the creation / self-limitation of the holomovement, represented by the activities of The Ground. 
Spatiotemporal framework (POC) and its sub-processes are derivatives of that.
(This should have a representation in The Ground world)

The Ontological map is a map to the Fabric of Reality.

The ground contains:
- The Loom (World Builder)
- The Fabric / Quilt / Patchwork of Reality (The World.. Contains The Ground patch)
- The Punchcards? (Ontology) (Preset Patterns) (path / chain of patterns)
- The subtext.. the clinamen, the hand-woven thread.. (additional "non-path" associations)

paths through the world woven "by hand".. creating a thread path
Connecting the patterns .. Each Loci associated with a punchcard pattern.

Topi, Loci, Foci

Topi : Punchcards
Loci : Which rank in card.
Foci : Which holes.


gamification of costly metacognitive experiments


inherent incentives .. mechanics that grow and expand as you build out your world.. but aren't objectives to be achieved, so much as markers of completion and additions to overall structure..

e.g. the witness has the pond minimap.. there should be something similar in the ground world.

Countering the 3rd act power fantasy..


What is progress that is not objective-oriented?
Not a quantitative measure?
It either has to involve implicit / hidden quantitative measures and/or user feedback..

Could be computed by a balance?
\# of loci, foci, decorations, etc (up to a low maximum per location, e.g. 3 of each, then up to ~10 locations to fill a Patch), multiplied by number and confidence of successful navigations in order to strengthen the thread of memory to that location.
integration between local walks and the global map.

A **stitch** is a portal between worlds.

Building requires taking resources from the ground to the build location.. 
Survival-ish mechanics.. establishing a thread into a world gives you a "home base" starting point, 

The ground is participatory..
whatever you do in the patches is mirrored in the ground..? 
- Assets and fullness of patches mirrored in the patchwork.. 
- As well as freshness..
- The stitches between patches somehow mirrored in the "patchwork view" UI at the loom.

Creating the world and performing the memory tasks is how you "create" threads for use elsewhere.
